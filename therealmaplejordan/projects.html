        <h3>Rotorship and the Magnus Effect</h3>
        <p>
          While in University, I had the chance to run my own experiment in fluid mechanics. The topic I chose was the Magnus Effect and how it works in a rotor ship. I was inspired by a video I saw online that you can check out <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23f1jvGUWJs">here</a> if you are unfamilar with the concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project aimed to create a small prototype of a rotorship, which is a ship that uses the Magnus Effect to move. Since the Magnus Effect as described above, requires a perpendicular force to work, it means that a rotorship is actually a wind powered ship. The force direction of the flettner rotor (rotor which allows proplusion from Magnus Effect) is perpendicular to the wind. During the experiment, I managed to create a flotation device with a fletter rotor that could move (be it only a little).

          Above we can see the motor with two o - rings attached to a pulley. This arrange is such so that the cylinders spin in the same direction as to allow the Magnus Force to align. The metal box is used as a body due to simplicity and weight.
