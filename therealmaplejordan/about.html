          <p>
            The Real Maple Jordan is a site run by yours truly, with two purposes. The first is to take a closer look at Canadian basketball in the NBA and related news. The other is to serve as a platform for me to learn and work on anything else I find interesting. While most of the content should be basketball related, I often get side tracked with other projects.

            About Me:
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a physics degree from the University of Victoria during which I have gained experiences with fluid mechanics, robotics, and coding. I have a keen interest in applying my skills in data analyst to the worlds of basketball or whatever is it I find interesting. One area of focus in most of my interest however, is data visualization and I want to use this platform to create clear and interesting infographics, dashboards and graphs.
